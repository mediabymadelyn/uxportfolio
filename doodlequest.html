          <!-- OVERVIEW -->
          <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              DoodleQuest is an AI-assisted creative coaching tool created to help beginner and intermediate 
              artists overcome art block, build foundational skills, and explore personal identity through 
              tailored prompts. The project began as a basic Java prompt generator during my first year, but 
              has since evolved into a major interdisciplinary research and design initiative supported by my 
              independent study and my approved CS + Studio Art major track.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work currently focuses on establishing the conceptual, ethical, and UX foundation for a 
              prompting system that encourages autonomy and self-discovery rather than rigid instruction.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- PROBLEM -->
          <section>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Generic prompts do not adapt to users’ goals, skill levels, or personal backgrounds.</li>
              <li>AI-generated prompts often reinforce Eurocentric norms and narrow aesthetic assumptions.</li>
              <li>Overly literal prompts restrict creativity and lead to “assignment-like” artwork.</li>
              <li>No continuity or memory — each prompt is treated as a one-off interaction.</li>
              <li>Most systems ignore identity, emotional state, or cultural nuance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Through autoethnographic research, I discovered that prompting 
              is not neutral—AI suggestions often reflect cultural biases and limit expressive freedom 
              if not designed critically.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- MY ROLE -->
          <section>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Conducted a semester-long autoethnographic independent study testing AI prompts.</li>
              <li>Created traditional and digital artworks to analyze prompt effectiveness.</li>
              <li>Developed a Prompt Evaluation Rubric (clarity, inclusivity, creativity, flexibility, engagement).</li>
              <li>Identified key limitations of AI models (bias, memory constraints, cultural defaults).</li>
              <li>Defined user needs, core modes, and interaction flows for future DoodleQuest development.</li>
              <li>Integrated research findings into my CS + Studio Art interdisciplinary major.</li>
            </ul>

          <!-- RESEARCH FOUNDATIONS -->
          <section>
            <h2>Research Foundations</h2>

            <h3>1. AI Reinforces Dominant Norms</h3>
            <p>
              Prompt tests showed that many AI suggestions default to Western symbolism, Eurocentric poses, 
              and narrow interpretations of color and narrative themes.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Good Prompts Are Contextual</h3>
            <p>
              Using my rubric, I found that strong prompts differ across experience levels, cultural contexts, 
              and emotional states. There is no universal “best” prompt.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Autonomy is Essential</h3>
            <p>
              Open-ended prompts produced more meaningful artwork than literal or instruction-like prompts.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Prompting is a Skill</h3>
            <p>
              Artists benefit from learning how to guide AI intentionally, rather than accepting its defaults.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Long-Term Memory Matters</h3>
            <p>
              Static, one-off interactions fail to support artistic growth. Personalized memory is crucial.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- DESIGN GOALS -->
          <section>
            <h2>Design Goals</h2>

            <h3>Personalized Prompting Modes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Art Block Mode:</strong> loose, open-ended inspiration based on interests.</li>
              <li><strong>Skill-Building Mode:</strong> guided prompts focusing on shading, gesture, composition, and color.</li>
              <li><strong>Identity Mode:</strong> prompts that incorporate cultural, emotional, and symbolic themes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Memory-Aware Interaction</h3>
            <p>DoodleQuest will remember:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Skill level & artistic goals</li>
              <li>Personal interests & themes</li>
              <li>Cultural background influences</li>
              <li>Past prompts & artworks</li>
              <li>User preferences over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Memory allows prompts to evolve as the artist grows, creating a coaching-like experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical & Inclusive Design</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid Eurocentric defaults and narrow aesthetics.</li>
              <li>Encourage multicultural imagery and interpretation.</li>
              <li>Promote autonomy, not compliance.</li>
              <li>Design prompts that invite exploration instead of dictating outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>UX Priorities</h3>
            <p>
              Inspired by my HCI coursework, the final interface will be intuitive, warm, and encouraging—
              designed for all levels of experience.
            </p>

          <!-- FUTURE DEVELOPMENT -->
          <section>
            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>
              As I move toward my senior project, DoodleQuest will evolve into a functional application with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>User accounts and personalized creative profiles.</li>
              <li>Conversational interactions with a reflective “DoodleBot.”</li>
              <li>Challenge modes and skill-building practice modules.</li>
              <li>Long-term memory tracking for growth-based prompting.</li>
              <li>Feedback loops based on user reflections and artworks.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <!-- REFLECTION -->
          <section>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              This project taught me that AI creativity tools should act more like collaborators than 
              instructors. Prompts influence artistic expression and must be designed with cultural 
              sensitivity and user autonomy in mind. DoodleQuest aims to invite exploration, reflection, 
              and identity-driven creativity—supporting artists not just in making art, but in 
              understanding their artistic voice.
